# attribute and methods make objects .
# basically what it has and what it does
# attributes is just a fancy word for variables.
# methods are functions of certain objects.
# in oops we make real life objects by combining data nad functionality.
# classes are like blueprint for objects . We can create objects using classes.


# for eg:
# car = CarBluePrint()
# car is object and CarBluePrint is class

# Notice that each word first letter is capitalized as convention.[pascal case


from turtle import *
timmy= Turtle()
print(timmy)
my_screen=Screen()
print(my_screen.canvheight)
# canvheight is a method

my_screen.exitonclick()
